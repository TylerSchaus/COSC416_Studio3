### Features Implemented: 
- Control and move a player from a third person perspective (WASD keys).
- Camera moves with player as it does in a typical third person game.
- Player can rotate 360 degrees using the mouse.
- Jump to and from platforms (SPACE key).
- Collect coins that rotate while floating above platforms.
- UI to keep track of total coins collected.
- Double jump mechanic (SPACE key).
- Dashing mechanic (I am not 100% happy with how this turned out, functionally it works, but does not feel as smooth as I would like) -- (F key).
- Invisible walls to keep player in the games boundaries.
